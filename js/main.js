// read the directions and press start to see the first clue and start the timer
// read the first clue
// look for the item that belongs to the clue
// use the hint button if stuck (hint will provide more directions/details on where to find the item)
// when the item is found, click on it
// when the item is clicked a border will appear around the item to signal it's been found
// when the mouse is released from the click the item will fill in the gray silhouette next to its clue
// repeat steps 2-7 until all items have been found
// win message if all items have been found before the timer runs out
// win message if immunity idol is found (can be at any point in the game)
// better luck next time if timer runs out before all items have been found
// losing message if player trys to skip ahead, costs them by having to start over while the timer is still running
