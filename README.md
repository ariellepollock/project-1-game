# SURVIVOR MATANIVIKA

## Objective
FIND ALL REQUESTED ITEMS BEFORE TIME RUNS OUT!!
This game functions just like iSpy, the twist is that you're racing against the clock and not every item you find will get you closer to the WIN. Help your tribe avoid tribal council by finding all the items needed to survive.

## Easter Egg
there's a hidden immunity idol out there, if you find it it's yours and you are guaranteed immunity (an automatic win)!

## Player's Directions: 
OUTWIT OUTPLAY OUTLAST
This is Survivor Matanivika; find all the items your tribe needs to make your time on the island that much more survivable. When you're ready, press start and begin the search. Keep in mind you're racing against the clock, find all the necessary items to win or else you'll be facing tribal council. Good luck!
