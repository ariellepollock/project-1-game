# SURVIVOR MATANIVIKA

## Objective
FIND ALL ITEMS BEFORE TIME RUNS OUT!!
This game functions just like ispy, the twist is that you have to find each item in order and you're racing against the clock. Help your tribe by finding all the items it needs to survive.

## Easter Egg
there's a hidden immunity idol out there, if you find it it's yours and you are guaranteed immunity (an automatic win)!

## User Story
As a user, I want the ability to...
- press start
- click on an item once "found"
- click on/"find" items in order (acception is immunity idol)
- optional: click on/"find" a hidden immunity idol (without a clue)
- click on/"find" all items OR immunity idol before timer runs out

## Player's Directions: 
OUTWIT OUTPLAY OUTLAST
This is Survivor Matanivika; find all the items your tribe needs to make your time on the island that much more survivable. Press start when you're ready and begin the search. Remember, you MUST find the item that fits the clue before you can move on to the next, if you try and skip ahead it could be a million dollar mistake.
